# NCAA NEXT '26  1985-2005 Historical Mod

This modification is based on the excellent NCAA NEXT '26 mod for NCAA 06.

## Requirements:
* NCAA Next 26 ISO (16.4 as of this writing) https://github.com/ncaanext/ncaa-next-26/releases
* antdroid's db editor: https://github.com/antdroidx/NCAA-DB-Editor/releases/
* antroidx's Ncaa Next tuning app: https://github.com/ncaanext/NCAANext-TuningApp/releases
* Talon42's Dynasty Manager https://github.com/Talon42/ncaa-next-dynasty-tracker (optional but HIGHLY recommended.)


## Features
* Rosters with real players from the 1985 - 2005 seasons.
* 12 team playoff
* Conference promotion/relegation
* Optional "House Rules" for added challenge.



## Warning About this Mod
 * This mod requires a decent amount of db editing every season.
 * Antdroid's DB editor makes this a breeze thankfully!
 * One example is the game will likely place at least a few T2 teams in the playoffs, which requires DB editing to fix.






### Rosters

* Many teams will have full rosters with real players from the 1985 - 2005 seasons.
Each of these teams will have at least one player from each decade per position in the depth chart, space permitting.

* Each player will be assigned a class based on when they played.

      1980's - JR
      1990's - SO
      2000's - FR

* Multi decade players' class will be the oldest decade in which they played.

    * Examples:
      * Josh Heupel - OU - 1999 - 2000 ---> Sophomore
      * Raghib Ismail - ND - 1988 - 1990 ---> Junior





### Conferences

There are four power conferences capped at 12 teams each.

     ACC
     Big 10
     Big 12
     SEC

There are four "tier 2" conferences each with an association to one of the power four conferences.

    American (ACC)
    Conference USA (SEC)
    Mt. West (BIG 12)
    PAC (Big 10)

There are two "tier 3" conferences. These could also be considered filler because the game breaks if too many conferences are disabled.

    MAC
    Sun Belt


## Playoffs

* 12 team playoff.
* Only teams from the power four are eligible.
* Each power four conference champ gets seeds 1-4 and a first round bye.
* Seeds 5 - 12 can be determined however the player wishes - as long as all teams are from the power four. _**Put on your CFP committee hat and create some controversy!**_



## Conference Promotion/Relegation

* After the season ends, the conference champion of each T2 conference will be promoted to their conference's associated T1 partner.
* The lowest ranked team in the T1 conference will be relegated to the T2 conference.


## Tier 2 Championship

* The T2 conference champions will have a four team playoff for the T2 championship.
* Three bowl games will be used for this mini-playoff.

```
CUSA vs American - Cheez it Citrus Bowl
Mt. West vs PAC - Holiday Bowl
T2 Final - Pop Tart Bowl
```
* The T2 champion will receive two "prizes":
    1. Immunity to relegation for two seasons.
    2. Can "poach" one player from the team they're replacing in T1.


## Tier 3 Championship

* Duke's Mayo Bowl
* MAC champ vs Sun Belt champ
* Winner of this game replaces the worst T2 conference team.

### Other Bowls
* All other bowl games have been disabled.
* This mod requires lots of manual DB editing every season. Having fewer bowl games reduces complexity in shuffling around teams.

### Optional "House Rules"

* You can only have one 99 OVR player on the field at any time. (Exception for special teams if your K or P is 99.)
* You can only have one 99 OVR player on your team per season
* Transfer portal enabled and set to HIGH.
